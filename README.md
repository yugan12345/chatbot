[![üîó Live Demo](https://img.shields.io/badge/üß™%20Try%20the%20Chatbot-Demo-blue?style=for-the-badge)](https://chabot-app-bsrraf2efxzxgimpsngbmd.streamlit.app/)

Welcome to the repository of a powerful chatbot that combines **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** with **FAISS** for intelligent, domain-specific conversations.  
All knowledge was gathered through **web scraping using Selenium**, indexed using FAISS, and served through an interactive **Streamlit** interface.

## üß± Workflow

1. **Web Scraping:**  
   - Used **Selenium** to scrape static data from selected websites.  
   - Cleaned and processed text using **BeautifulSoup**.

2. **Embedding + Indexing:**  
   - Converted documents to vector embeddings.  
   - Stored them in a **FAISS** index for fast retrieval.

3. **Chatbot Flow:**  
   - User inputs query ‚Üí FAISS retrieves top-k similar chunks ‚Üí LLM generates a final answer using the context.
