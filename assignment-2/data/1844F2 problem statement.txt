problem statement-1844F2:
The only difference between this problem and the easy version is the constraints on t and n.
You are given an array of n positive integers a1,…,an, and a (possibly negative) integer c.
Across all permutations b1,…,bn of the array a1,…,an, consider the minimum possible value of 
∑i=1n−1|bi+1−bi−c|.
\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} |b_{i+1}-b_i-c|.
 Find the lexicographically smallest permutation 

b
b
 of the array 

a
a
 that achieves this minimum.
A sequence x is lexicographically smaller than a sequence y if and only if one of the following holds:
 x is a prefix of y, but x≠y; in the first position where x and y differ, the sequence x has a smaller element than the corresponding element in y.
