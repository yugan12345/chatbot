Solution statetment- 1844B - Permutations & Primes:
Hint 1 
 In order for (l,r) to contribute to the primality, we must have MEX(al,…,ar)≥2, so there is some value 1 between indices l and r. 
Hint 2 
 To maximize the number of pairs (l,r) that contain the value 1, we should put 1 near the middle of the array. 
Hint 3 
 To minimize the number of pairs (l,r) where MEX(al,…,ar)≥2 but is not prime, we should put 2 and 3 at the ends of the array. 
The cases n≤2 can be handled separately. For n≥3, any construction with a1=2,a⌊(n+1)/2⌋=1,an=3 is optimal. We can prove this as follows: Note that since 2 and 3 are both prime, any (l,r) with l≤⌊n+12⌋≤r has a prime MEX(al,…,ar) except for possibly (l,r)=(1,n), where MEX(a1,…,an)=n+1. Therefore the primality of this array is ⌊n+12⌋⋅⌈n+12⌉−[n+1 is not prime], where [P]=1 if proposition P is true and 0 if P is false. On the other hand, for any permutation of 1,…,n, let k be the index with ak=1. The primality of this array cannot exceed k(n+1−k)−[n+1 is not prime], since any pair (l,r) with prime MEX(al,…,ar)≥2 must satisfy l≤k≤r, and additionally MEX(a1,…,an)=n+1 no matter what the permutation is. The function f(k)=k(n+1−k) is a quadratic which is maximized at k=⌊n+12⌋, so k(n+1−k)−[n+1 is not prime]≤⌊n+12⌋⋅⌈n+12⌉−[n+1 is not prime] as required.The time complexity is O(n) (note that we don't even need to sieve for primes!).
