problem statement-1844E:
An n×m grid of characters is called great if it satisfies these three conditions: 
  Each character is either 'A', 'B', or 'C'.  Every 2×2 contiguous subgrid contains all three different letters.  Any two cells that share a common edge contain different letters. 
Let (x,y) denote the cell in the x-th row from the top and y-th column from the left.
You want to construct a great grid that satisfies k constraints. Each constraint consists of two cells, (xi,1,yi,1) and (xi,2,yi,2), that share exactly one corner. You want your great grid to have the same letter in cells (xi,1,yi,1) and (xi,2,yi,2).
Determine whether there exists a great grid satisfying all the constraints.
