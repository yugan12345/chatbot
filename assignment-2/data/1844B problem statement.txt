problem 1844B
You are given a positive integer n.
In this problem, the MEX of a collection of integers c1,c2,…,ck is defined as the smallest positive integer x which does not occur in the collection c. 
The primality of an array a1,…,an is defined as the number of pairs (l,r) such that 1≤l≤r≤n and MEX⁡(al,…,ar) is a prime number. 
Find any permutation of 1,2,…,n with the maximum possible primality among all permutations of 1,2,…,n. 
Note: 
  A prime number is a number greater than or equal to 2 that is not divisible by any positive integer except 1 and itself. For example, 2,5,13 are prime numbers, but 1 and 6 are not prime numbers.  A permutation of 1,2,…,n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).
