Solution statetment-1844D - Row Major:
Hint 1 
 Describe, using a graph, all the pairs of characters in s that need to be different. 
Hint 2 
 Consider the smallest positive integer that does not divide n. 
The condition is equivalent to a graph of pairs of characters in s that need to be different. In graph-theoretic language, we need to find the chromatic number of this graph.By considering the 1×n and n×1 grids, there is an edge between character u and u+1 for all 1≤u≤n−1. By considering a nd×d grid (where d divides n), there is an edge between character u and u+d for all 1≤u≤n−d whenever d divides n. Let c be the smallest positive integer that does not divide n. There is an edge between every pair of the characters 1,…,c (in graph-theoretic language, this is a clique), so the answer is at least c. On the other hand, consider the string obtained by letting s1,…,sc be all distinct characters and repeating this pattern periodically (si=si+c for all 1≤i≤n−c). Any pair of equal characters have an index difference that is a multiple of c, say kc. But since c does not divide n, kc also does not divide n, so these characters are not connected by an edge. Therefore this construction gives a suitable string with c distinct characters.The time complexity is O(n).
