At the same time, the prize money Monocarp can earn in competitions depends on his skill level. Therefore, Monocarp decided that he could sacrifice participating in some competitions to train and increase his skill level on those days.

Two training plans are considered different if there exists a day that is a training day in one plan and a competition day in the other one.",
    "input_spec": "The first line contains a single integer nn (1≤n≤2⋅1051≤n≤2⋅105) — the number of days when competitions will take place. The second line contains nn integers a1,a2,…,ana1,a2,…,an (0≤ai≤1060≤ai≤106) — the base prize money that Monocarp can expect.",
    "output_spec": "Print two integers — the maximum total income that Monocarp can achieve with an optimal training plan and the number of such plans. Since the number of plans may be too big, print it modulo 998244353998244353."
