    "statement": "In a showmatch for a computer game, 2n2n esports players are set to participate; the rating of the ii-th player is aiai. The ratings of all players are distinct. For each player, the most exciting match will be with the player whose rating is the closest to theirs. Formally, for the ii-th player, the best opponent is another player jj such that the absolute difference in their ratings |ai−aj||ai−aj| is minimized among all ways to choose player jj. Note that some player can have more than one best opponent. For example, if there are 44 esports players with ratings [3,7,5,12][3,7,5,12], then: The organizers of the showmatch want to pair the participants so that each player is in exactly one pair, and in each pair, the players are best opponents for each other. Determine whether such a pairing exists.",
