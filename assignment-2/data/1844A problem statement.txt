problem 1857A:
You are given two positive integers, a and b (a<b).
For some positive integer n, two players will play a game starting with a pile of n stones. They take turns removing exactly a or exactly b stones from the pile. The player who is unable to make a move loses.
Find a positive integer n such that the second player to move in this game has a winning strategy. This means that no matter what moves the first player makes, the second player can carefully choose their moves (possibly depending on the first player's moves) to ensure they win.
