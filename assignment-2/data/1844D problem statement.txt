problem statement-1844D:
The row-major order of an r×c grid of characters A is the string obtained by concatenating all the rows, i.e. 
A11A12…A1cA21A22…A2c…Ar1Ar2…Arc.
 A_{11}A_{12} \dots A_{1c}A_{21}A_{22} \dots A_{2c} \dots A_{r1}A_{r2} \dots A_{rc}. 
A grid of characters A is bad if there are some two adjacent cells (cells sharing an edge) with the same character.
You are given a positive integer n. Consider all strings s consisting of only lowercase Latin letters such that they are not the row-major order of any bad grid. Find any string with the minimum number of distinct characters among all such strings of length n.
It can be proven that at least one such string exists under the constraints of the problem.
