Solution 
 1844C - ParticlesConsider
Hint 1 
 The answer is the sum of some subset of c1,…,cn. Think about which subsets are obtainable. 
Hint 2 
 Consider the set of even-indexed particles and the set of odd-indexed particles. 
 the set of even-indexed particles and the set of odd-indexed particles. Observe that particles can only ever combine with other particles from the same set. It follows that the answer is at most max(∑odd imax(ci,0),∑even imax(ci,0)).On the other hand, this bound is almost always obtainable. We can first perform the operation on all negatively charged particles in the same set as the desired final particle, then perform the operation on all the particles from the opposite set. There is a corner case where all particles are negative, where the answer is just max(c1,…,cn).The time complexity is O(n). 
Implementation: 
 #include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
typedef long long int LLI;

int c[200000];
int main() {
    int i;
    int t,n;
    scanf("%d",&t);
    while (t--) {
        scanf("%d",&n);
        for (i = 0; i < n; i++) scanf("%d",&c[i]);

        int allneg = 1;
        for (i = 0; i < n; i++) allneg &= (c[i] < 0);
        if (allneg) printf("%d\n",*max_element(c,c+n));
        else {
            LLI ans1 = 0,ans2 = 0;
            for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                if (i & 1) ans1 += max(c[i],0);
                else ans2 += max(c[i],0);
            }
            printf("%lld\n",max(ans1,ans2));
        }
    }
    return 0;
}
